				<h2>Bereet</h2>
				<p>Bereet was a female Krylorian techno-artist who used her alien technology to produce films concerning fictional adventures of herself and the Hulk. Most of the population is obsessed with the escapist movie-like fantasies of techno-art films, leading to her popularity among her people.[1] Bereet later traveled to Earth and became involved with the Hulk while he had Bruce Banner's intelligence, befriending the Hulk and Rick Jones. She also encountered the criminal Jackdaw.
				<br>
				Bereet used a number of devices such as the spatial distorter, Banshee Mask, Defendroids, her "pet" Sturky, and a variety of other advanced technological devices.
				<br>
				The planet Krylor and its population was destroyed by Ego the Living Planet during the onset of the Maximum Security crossover.</p>

				<h2>Carina</h2>
				<p>Carina was the assistant of Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.
				<br>
				When Gamora, Star-Lord, Rocket, Groot, and Drax delivered the Power Stone to the Collector, Carina seized the opportunity to free herself of slavery and tried to steal the Infinity stone. She grabbed the stone, however she was not strong enough to handle it; her body exploded with energy, killing her, and destroying much of the Collector's collection.</p>

				<h2>The Collector</h2>
				<p>Like all the Elders of the Universe, the origin of the Collector is lost in antiquity. What is known is that he is one of the oldest living beings in the universe, having been among the first of the universe's races to become sentient in the wake of the Big Bang. Virtually immortal, the Collector spent the first millennia of his existence with his wife and daughter on the tranquil world he chose as his home base. When their daughter had grown to maturity and left them, the Collector's wife died of mysterious causes. The Collector was unprepared for her demise: he had thought her as immortal as well. In meditation, he realized that an important factor in an Elder's immortality is the will to live, and his wife had simply lost hers.</p>

				<h2>Cosmo</h2>
				<p>Heading up the security forces in a place called Knowhere, Cosmo met a distraught Nova shortly after he witnessed a female alien with the alias Suspensor turned into a zombie right before his eyes. She attacked, and Nova accidentally killed the woman in self defense only to have her allies Cynosure, Crater and Discharge blame him for her death. Unable to battle the three powerful aliens, Nova retreated and was surprised yet again with his discovery of a talking dog. However, Cosmo gained Nova’s trust and friendship, and the two set out to find the fiend responsible for all the recent deaths on Knowhere.</p>

				<h2>Gamora</h2>
				<p>Thanos discovered the infant Gamora after the Zen-Whoberi race had been demolished by the Universal Church of Truth.
				<br>
				Thanos used the machines aboard his ship, Sanctuary II, to bring Gamora back in time by two decades and bring her body to peak perfection. He also altered Gamora's perceptions, so that she would not see how evil he was. Thanos sent Gamora into the Universal Church Of Truth, hoping she would cause chaos and also assassinate the Church's leader, the Magus. Gamora then aided Adam Warlock against the Magus, leading to the Magus' defeat.</p>

				<h2>Garthan Saal</h2>
				<p>Garthaan Saal, a member of the Xandarian Nova Corps, was one of the few Xandarians who survived the destruction of Xandar at the hands of Nebula the space pirate.
				<br>
				Garthaan Saal contained the power of the entire Nova Corps within his body which increased him to the size of a giant and drove him mad. Supernova's desire for revenge against Nebula led him on a quest to track her down and exact his revenge. He had heard that Nebula had recently been a member of the Avengers (in actuality this was a temporal counterpart to Kang's long lost love Ravonna who assumed the guise of Nebula).
				<br>
				Supernova first attacked the Avenger Starfox (another alleged relative of Nebula's) in space which led to a confrontation between Supernova and the combined forces of the Avengers, Fantastic Four and fellow surviving Xandarian Firelord (a former herald of Galactus). Supernova was only defeated by tricking him into the timestream to find the woman he believed was Nebula as she had been lost in the timestream during a previous encounter with the Avengers.</p>

				<h2>Howard the Duck</h2>
				<p>Duckworld, a planet in another dimension where intelligent life evolved from waterfowl, resembles Earth in an astounding number of ways, including the fact that ducks speak English. (In fact, Howard mistook Earth for Duckworld on his arrival, until he saw the “hairless apes” wandering around.) Howard was born the eldest son of Dave and Dottie, but beyond enjoying his rocking horse on Christmas as a baby, he disappointed them in every other way. He couldn’t hold down any job, be it serious or frivolous, and couldn’t fit in to any group. Instead, he figured he had no use for society, despite his ability to adapt to any situation and society, and found content as a malcontent.</p>

				<h2>Irani Rael</h2>
				<p>After the destruction of the Nova Corps by the Annihilation Wave, the Xandarian Worldmind secretly sought out new recruits during Richard Rider's sleep hours. Irani Rael, a Rigellian, was among those first selected to be a new Nova Centurion. Soon after her selection, the Worldmind transmitted an emergency signal as the result of nearly being destroyed by Galactus. Irani joined with the four other Centurions to have been selected thus far Qubit, Malik Tarcel, Morrow and Fraktur -- and tracked down the Worldmind's signal.</p>

				<h2>Korath</h2>
				<p>Korath-Thak is a brilliant cyber-geneticist who was one of the creators of the Pursuer project, creating an energy template that could transform any matter it touched into a form it could use to pursue and subdue its intended targets. The first use of the template was at the instigation of the Kree science council to bring the Inhumans of Earth to Hala to serve as conscripts in the Kree army. This action would insight the conflict that has come to be known as the "War of Three Galaxies." The template was beamed to Earth but instead of hitting stones or metal as hoped, it hit and transformed cockroaches. In this form the Pursuer defeated the Inhumans Royal family; (Black Bolt, Medusa, Gorgon, Karnak, and Triton) until the Kree defector Falzon used an insecticide to stop the template.</p>

				<h2>Nebula</h2>
				<p>Nebula, feared across numerous star systems for her ruthless piracy, set her sights on Sanctuary II, the solar-orbiting satellite built and once used as a base of operations by the Thanos. She had sent a small band of her most trusted aides to Sanctuary II to repair its hyper-drive engines and teleport the station out of the solar system, but the activity coincided with the arrival of the hero Monica Rambeau (as Captain Marvel), who had been sent to investigate the craft by her team the Avengers. Nebula's minions warped the satellite out of the solar system with Captain Marvel aboard and rendezvoused with Nebula.</p>

				<h2>Peter Quill</h2>
				<p>Wrongly branded a traitor by his father Eson, Prince Jason of Spartoi fled the Empire, exploring deep space for many years. When war broke out between the Spartoi Empire and the Ariguan Confederacy, Eson summoned his wayward son home, but en route his ship's converter blew. To avoid a complete meltdown, and with his ship apparently slipping backwards through time, Jason crash landed in Earth's Colorado Mountains, his arrival witnessed by Meredith Quill, who dragged him from the burning vessel. As she nursed him back to health and helped him rebuild his ship, the pair fell in love. After a year, Jason was ready to depart; informed by his bio-comps that Meredith had just conceived their child and unwilling to endanger her, Jason reluctantly left Meredith behind, promising to return for her once the war ended, but mindlocking her memories, sparing her the heartbreak he felt. Less than a month later, Meredith married her childhood sweetheart, Jake.</p>

				<br>
				However, Zorr was too powerful for Dey and mortally wounded him. Dey flew to Earth ahead of Zorr and randomly chose Richard Rider as the new Nova, transferring his power to him. Dey linked minds with Rider and explained to him the new powers he has received as well as the threat of Zorr on his planet.
				<br>
				At first, Rider thought the encounter was a dream, but soon discovered his powers and accepted his role as Nova. While out testing them for the first time he ran into Zorr who was on a rampage in New York City. Nova decided to fulfill Dey's dying wish and defeat Zorr. During the battle, Zorr was teleported away by Dey himself. Dey killed Zorr before he himself died, ready to join his family and friends in the afterlife</p>

				<h2>Rocket Racoon</h2>
				<p>Hundreds of years ago, humanoids from an unidentified planet sought a world to use as an asylum for their outcast insane members, and settled on a planet located in the Keystone Quadrant, out by the stars of Sirus Major. There the psychiatrists created robots to care for their patients' particular brands of insanity. For years they studied the functions and dysfunctions of the mind, writing their observations in the starship Gideon's logbook until their funding was cut off and they were ordered back to their homeworld. As they left, they erected a forcefield-generating Galacian Wall around the star system to keep their uncured patients safe from the normal society that loathed them. 
				<br>
				For generations the robots faithfully watched over their charges, whose children were born insane themselves, or affected by their insane environment. The Loonies, as they came to be known, created a religion worshiping the ancient Shrinks as gods, with straight-jacketed priests called the Good Humor Men venerating the logbook as their Bible, housing it in the Admissions Ward and performing rites to attain the Final Cure. Gaining sentence (due in part to radiation from a nearby star going nova), the supremely logical robots sought a way out from directly caring for their illogical charges. They played around with the genetics of the various companion animals left by the Shrinks and created a race of animal people to care for the Loonies while the robots retreated to their own side of the planet and began to work on a giant humanoid starship, and started to deduce how to shut down the Wall from the inside. Over time the planet came to be known as Halfworld, divided between the robots' industrial half, and the verdant half occupied by the others, with the robots building toys designed by the animals to keep the Loonies entertained, and making other machines and weapons for the animals' use only, and giving many animals requested cybernetic enhancements. Over time the animals created their own advanced society somewhat apart from the Loonies, with the major industry toymaking for the Loonies' amusements, and the Loonies paying for services rendered with animal cracker currencies.</p>

				<h2>Ronan the Accuser</h2>
				<p>Ronan was born into one of the leading Kree aristocratic families on Hala.

				<h2>Yondu Udonta</h2>
				<p>Yondu Udonta was a game hunter of the primitive Zatoan tribe, which were humanoid beings who were native to Centauri IV. The first planet system to be colonized outside of the Sun's solar system; the colonization took place sometime during the 29th century. Due to their being intimidated by the Earth's superior technology, most Centaurian tribes established peaceful relationships with the settlers. Yondu's tribe, however, migrated from their ancestral forests to the less accessible plains, thus avoiding contact with the outworlders. 200 years after the Centaurians first contact with Earth, a ship bearing the astronaut Vance Astro arrived on Centauri IV, using an antiquated mode of star travel. Astro soon found out that Earth had beaten him to his destination centuries before, using advanced star-drive engines. Astro continued to engage in his reconnaissance mission of the planet, despite the fact that it was now obsolete.</p>
